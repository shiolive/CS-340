How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is important to follow best practices in software development. One way that I achieved this in my CRUD python module was modular design to allow better readability and reusability. It is also important to have robust error handling built in to ensure there are not gaps being missed. I wrote tests that tested that the code worked as well as handled errors correctly while testing both positive and negative inputs.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, the process usually begins by understanding the problem as well as the end goal. I would then break it down into manageable parts, research the appropriate methods and tools to use, and then iteratively develop and test the solution until it met or exceeded the requirements originally outlined in the understanding/planning phase.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists understand, design, and apply computer technologies to solve complex problems and build tools to improve daily processes. The work computer scientists do drive innovation in todays world, as well as increase efficiency and productivity for organizations by doing things such as automating tasks and optimizing regular processes. They also ensure data is handled securely and effectively in an organized manner. These are examples of the ways that Grazioso Salvare has leveraged the work of a computer scientist to improve their work.
